# RailsCast Syntax Theme

Syntax theme based on the RailsCast theme by [ericfreese](https://github.com/ericfreese/atom-railscast-theme), which again is converted from the TextMate version by Ryan Bates (@rbates).

This fork adds support for the markup syntax used in [language-markdown](https://atom.io/packages/language-markdown).
The PR is slow to merge, hence this fork.
